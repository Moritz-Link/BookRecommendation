# BookRecommendation

In this project, I developed a Django application to recommend books to a user based on his selection. The underlying ML model is a GNN which operates on the user,rating,book graph.

Data: The Book Crossing Dataset from 'http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/BX-CSV-Dump.zip'
Method: A SAGEGnn.

File for the model training: https://github.com/Moritz-Link/BookRecommendation/blob/main/modelTraining.ipynb
